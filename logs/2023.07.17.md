Need to figure out what the big idea is.

AI as we're calling it is, in my opinion, "not a big deal", and is just some niche of software automation more than anything in most cases.

Society doesn't agree.

And the business motivations behind why we call just a normal niche of software automation "AI" is predictable lingual subterfuge.

But, it's not wrong necessarily, it's just hype and not near capable of replacing any workforce -- yet.

That said, I mean, those are my (incredibly technically valid) opinions, and I might as well know my market.

People consider AI to be a big deal.

The game's angle is already intriguing for a number of reasons, given AI.

But I need to figure out what the commentary on society thing is, what time it's set in, etc etc.

There's definitely a way to tie it all together.
